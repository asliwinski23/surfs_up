## Project Overview
The scenario in this project is that the year is 2017 and you want to open an ice cream and surf apparel shop in Oahu, Hawaii. There are interested investors, but in order to convince them that this shop will be profitable year round, you are asked to do an analysis of the weather in Oahu. One investor, W. Avy provides you with a SQLite database with the weather information in Oahu from 2010 through August 2017.

To make it clear that the weather in Oahu will be a great location for this shop all year, you decide to first look at weather data from June and from December and they are traditionally the hottest and coldest months of the year, respectively. 

Eventually, W. Avy and you will present your findings to their board of directors. Since the board is not interested in directly reading your code, you decide to make a website for them to easily filter through your analysis.
